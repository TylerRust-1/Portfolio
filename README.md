### Change Log
8/31/2021 - I read up on using Markdown to create this portfolio [Github Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

9/5/2021 - Got set up with VSCode using  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)  
  [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling)  
  [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/c63ec5/building-a-simple-website-with-typescript/](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/c63ec5/building-a-simple-website-with-typescript/)  
  Pretty comfortable with using Git in VSCode, initializing repositories, committing changes, pushing, pulling, branching. 
    
9/6/2021 - I built a working Pokedex on Github pages: https://strrules105.github.io/Pokedex/  
This was done using a guide at [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/). There were a couple of challenges with the guide being a year or two old, but most things worked, and I just had to make small adjustments in the tsconfig, css, and then I added hyperlinks to each of the Pokemon's Wikipedia pages.
  
9/7/2021 - Trying to learn React by following a tutorial on how to make TicTacToe, guide can be found [Here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
  
9/9/2021 - Added "Change Log" and "To Do" sections, I think it looks fine, let me know if I should rearrange my content.
  
9/11/2021 - Updated To Do section with plans on reorganizing this whole Portfolio.

### To Do
Currently, I intend on building a website similar to what one of my friends, Michael Young, has built [https://runeflip.herokuapp.com/](https://runeflip.herokuapp.com/) I wasn't sure if herokuapp provided more functionality than Github pages, so I intend to try it out and see which I like most. After I figure this project out with the OldSchool Runescape API, I want to make a webpage that tracks my stock investments without the need for my brokerage app.

It might be possible in the future to make the Pokedex subpages myself and further use the API to grab stats and descriptions.

I might drop the TicTacToe project, doesn't seem all too interesting, but I just want to find a good guide/tutorial for React

Going to make my own HTML code for the website instead of Markdown like I have been using. I think I'll be able to make the layout much more clean and organized. Also, I will separate the changelog from the work accomplished, I only set it up the way it is now because we were given such short notice.
