### Change Log
8/31/2021 - I read up on using Markdown to create this portfolio [Github Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

9/5/2021 - Got set up with VSCode using  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics]  
  [https://nodejs.org/en/download/]  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial]  
  [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling]  
  [https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/c63ec5/building-a-simple-website-with-typescript/]  
  Currently, I intend on building the website at [https://trustproject1.herokuapp.com/], I intend for the functionality of this       website to be similar to what one of my friends, Michael Young, has built https://runeflip.herokuapp.com/ I wasn't sure if herokuapp provided more functionality than Github pages, so I intend to try it out and see which I like most. After I figure this project out with the OldSchool Runescape API, I want to make a webpage that tracks my stock investments without the need for my brokerage app.
  
9/6/2021 - I built a working Pokedex on Github pages: https://strrules105.github.io/Pokedex/  
This was done using a guide at [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-practical-guide-to-typescript-how-to-build-a-pokedex-app-using-html-css-and-typescript/]. There were a couple of challenges with the guide being a year or two old, but most things worked, and I jsut had to make small adjustments in the tsconfig, css, and then I added hyperlinks to each of the Pokemon's Wikipedia pages. It might be possible in the future to make the subpages myself and further use the API to grab stats and descriptions.

9/7/2021 - Trying to learn React by following a tutorial on how to make TicTacToe, guide can be found [Here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
