8/31/2021 - I read up on using Markdown to create this portfolio [Github Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

9/5/2021 - Got set up with VSCode using

  Currently, I intend on building the website at https://trustproject1.herokuapp.com/, I intend for the functionality of this       website to be similar to what one of my friends, Michael Young, has built https://runeflip.herokuapp.com/ I wasn't sure if herokuapp provided more functionality than Github pages, so I intend to try it out and see which I like most. After I figure this project out with the OldSchool Runescape API, I want to make a webpage that tracks my stock investments without the need for my brokerage app.
